# Title: Using Demonstrative Pronouns This and That
## Concepts: Etat, Tat

# Lesson
A demonstrative pronoun is where you have to point and speak the pronoun.  It is location specific.  In English, it would be this versus that.  For example, This Fruit (near me) versus That Fruit (away from me).  A similar concept exists in Sanskrit.  If it is near the speaker, we use 'Etat'.  It is away from the speaker, we point to that object and use 'Tat'.  These pronouns are only used when referring to objects like books or house, not for addressing people.
