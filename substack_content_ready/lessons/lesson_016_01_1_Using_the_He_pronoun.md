# Title: Using the "He" pronoun - Sah and Eshaha
## Concepts: (a) Sah (b) Eshaha

### Image Link:   

## Lesson
In Sanskrit, the word for He is contextual.  It can either be e·π£a·∏•  or ·π£a·∏•.   If the person is away from you, we would say sah.  If the person is near to you, we use e·π£a·∏•. 


## Practice: 
Please practice using Esah, and Sah. The goal is to match the correct pronoun with the person in the picture and creating a sentence.  An example is given below.  Practice by filling in the blanks for others:  Some of the rows have been filled in as an example.  Fill in the blanks for the remaining rows.
