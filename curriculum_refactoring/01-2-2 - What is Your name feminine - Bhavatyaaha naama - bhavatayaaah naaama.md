# Title: 1.1.2 What is Your name? feminine - Bhavatyāḥ nāma - भवत्याः नाम
## Concepts: "Bhavatyāḥ nāma kim"

## Learning
In Sanskrit, to ask "What is your name?" to a female person, we use "Bhavatyāḥ nāma kim?". "Bhavatyāḥ" is the respectful form of "you" for females, "nāma" means "name", and "kim" means "what". This is the polite way to ask a woman's name.

| भवत्याः नाम किम् ? | Bhavatyāḥ nāma kim? | What is your name? (to a female) |
