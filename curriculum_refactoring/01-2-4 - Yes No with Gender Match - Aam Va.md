# Title: Practice matching pronouns as per gender
## Concepts: Gender Matching Pronouns with Aam, Vaa, Na

### Lesson
Every word in Sanskrit has a gender.  It can be Feminine, Masculine or Neutral.  Look at the pronouns in the reference table below.  Then practice Vaa (question) with it.  Give answer Na if it doesn't match.  A couple of examples are given below to help you get started.

## Practice
Practice using the correct gender based on the pronoun.  Formulate your own question, and provide two answers for this.  The first two rows demonstrates this.  Take one Named Pronoun (For example Nirmala, Rohini etc shown in Table 1), then an third person gender pronoun (For example Baalika, Vaidyaḥ shown in Table 2) and finally add  'Vaa'  to it converting the statement into a question.  So you get questions like this: "Nirmala Baalika Vaa?" or "Nirmala Vaidyah Vaa?" or "Nirmala Vaidyā Vaa?" etc.  Next, practice providing answers to this question so that the genders match.  Since Nirmala is Feminine, we respond positively and state "Aam, Nirmala Baalika." We can also respond negatively with Na as in "Sa Yuvatiḥ Na" because Yuvatiḥ is masculine gender which doesn't match with Nirmala's negative gender.  Also notice that we use the "Sa" pronoun because it is Feminine Gender and matches with Nirmala's gender.
