# Title: 1.8.1 This man's & That man's - masculine - etasya tasya - एतस्य तस्य
## Concepts: "etasya tasya - Of this Of that"

## Learning
In Sanskrit, the pronoun to be used is contextual.  We have already seen that the "This" demonstrative pronoun has three variations based on gender: Saha, Saa and Tat). However, a different pronoun is to be used if we want to be both demonstrative (you have to point to the individual) and possessive (it answers the "to whom" question).  Let's review these two pronouns for the masculine gender in this lesson.

- एतस्य (etasya): This pronoun is used only for the masculine gender.  It Means "this man's" when the person or object is near the speaker. In English, we use the apostrophe "'s" like this: "This man's dress is green", or "This man's name is Rama". "Etasya" is similar to Eshaha but it also addresses the question of "to whom does it belong?".  For example: To whom does the dress belong?  It belongs to this man.  Therefore, we would state: "It is this man's dress".  In Sanskrit, that would be "Etasya vastram एतस्य वस्त्रम्".  More examples have been given below for gaining clarity.
- तस्य (tasya): Tasya means "That Man's".  Etasya एतस्य means "This man's" while Tasya तस्य means "That man's".  In English, we use the apostrophe "'s" like this: "That man's name is Rama".  In Sanskrit, this would be: ""tasya nāma Rāmaḥ तस्य नाम रामः"

For those who like English grammer, this is referred to as the genitive case and is used to indicate ownership, connection and closeness between nouns.
