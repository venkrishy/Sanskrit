# Title: 1.2.2 This That - feminine - eṣā sā - एषा सा
## Concepts: "eṣā sā - This That"

## Learning
In Sanskrit, "eṣā" means "this" and "sā" means "that" when referring to feminine nouns. These are demonstrative pronouns used to point to objects or people. When the noun being referred to is feminine in gender, then the feminine form is used.

In Sanskrit, unlike in English, the form must match the gender.  In English, there is no gender matching for the word "This", so we can state "This boy" and "This girl" and "This book".  However, this is not so in Sanskrit.  There would be three forms of "This" for the three gender types (Masculine, Feminine, Neuter).  We would have to state: Saḥ Bālakaḥ for Masculine, Sā Bālikā सा बालिका for Feminine and Etat pustakam for Neuter gender.  In this lesson, we are focusing only on the feminine gender.
