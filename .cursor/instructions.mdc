# Copilot Automated Dependency Management Instructions

- Always ensure `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are in sync and use compatible versions for all dependencies.
- If dependency conflicts or install errors occur, automatically:
  1. Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`.
  2. Update `package.json` to use only compatible, stable versions (prefer LTS or latest stable for major frameworks like React, Vite, Tailwind, etc.).
  3. Run `npm install` again.
- Prefer not to use `--force` or `--legacy-peer-deps` flags unless absolutely necessary.
- If user requests, proceed with these steps without further confirmation.
- Document all changes and actions taken in the session.
