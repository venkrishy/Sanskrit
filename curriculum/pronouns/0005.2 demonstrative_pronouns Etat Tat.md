# Lesson
A demonstrative pronoun where you have to point and speak the pronoun.  It is location specific.  In English, it would be this vs that.  For example, This Fruit (near me) versus That Fruit (away from me).  A similar concept exists in Sanskrit.  If it is at touching distance, we use Etat.  It is away from us, we use Tat.  These are only used when referring to objects like books or house, not for addressing people.
